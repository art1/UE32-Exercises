# UE32-Exercises
This repository contains the programming exercises for the course "UE32 - Informatiqu√©" (2016/2017) at the Paul-Sabatier University Toulouse for the "Techniques Spatiales et Instrumentation" (SpaceMaster 2nd year). 

Each Exercise is done in a separate branch. The following PDF's contain the appropriate exercise sheets with the tasks:

### [Exercise 1](https://github.com/art1/UE32-Exercises/blob/master/Exercises-1-C%2B%2B.pdf) - C++ Programming in General
everything's in branch [Ex1](../Ex1/UE32_1/main.cpp) - only one file - all tasks written in void main(..). It is super beautiful spaghetti-code.
